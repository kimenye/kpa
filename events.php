    <p class="more">Kenya Paediatric Association is delighted to be hosting the 16th Annual Scientific Conference on 26th-29th April 2016. The theme of this conference will be ‘Non-Communicable Diseases: A Focus on Early Life Determinants’. Kenya has made great strides in reducing communicable diseases through expanding vaccination programs and improved primary health care. It is with this in mind that our focus for this year’s conference has shifted to NCD’s that account for an enormous burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide and are often due to modifiable factors.</p>
