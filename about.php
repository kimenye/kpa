      <h2>Our History</h2>

      <p>The Kenya Paediatric Association (KPA) is a nonprofit, non-partisan body of paediatric practitioners committed to professional excellence and timely, quality service delivery to the children they serve.</p>

      <p>KPA was started in 1968 by a small group of paediatricians who were then providing healthcare services to a rapidly growing population. The purpose of the association then was to provide members with professional support and share clinical information that would enable them to handle new and emerging children's diseases. </p>


      <p>The rationale for the association has not changed much since then. What has changed is the scope of its coverage and the occurrence of new and emerging diseases and trends among a diverse and growing population. </p>

      <p>In order to address itself effectively to this highly dynamic world where health has been classified as a right and enshrined in the Constitution, it is incumbent upon the association and its members to address themselves to this expediently.</p>
